book-code
=========

This repository contains all the code and examples belonging to the O'Reilly eXist book.

It contains the following files:

* eXist-book.xar 
  This is the example code as an installable package. It will 
  install all the example code and setup the indexes.

* EXISTBACKUPZIP-eXist-book.zip 
  This is the same example code as eXist-book.xar but now in an eXist 
  backup file. You can restore this using the Java Admin Client but this 
  will not install the index configurations.
  
* EXISTBACKUPZIP-exist101.zip
  This is an eXist backup file with the example code of the eXist 101 
  chapter.
